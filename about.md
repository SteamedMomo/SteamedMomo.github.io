Hey there!  

Name's Sarthak and I'm from India. As of writing this post, I'm an 18 year old student attending Delhi Technological University(Fomerly DCE). I have been aboard the IT-learning train since 2014 and aspiring to be an IT expert (Hard to be any more specific than this).  

I'm mainly interested in Machine Learning, Networking and Information Security. I'm fluent in C,C++ and Java (atleast the basics) and am learning Python.  
I also love watching Anime, online gaming and experimenting with Digital Art every now and then.
