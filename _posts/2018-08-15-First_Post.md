This blog is finally ready! <br>
From now on, this is where I will be sharing all the projects/programs I make. I ran a blog on Blogspot [here](http://realmomosenpai.blogspot.com) before deciding to switch to GitHub, to provide a more professional outlook to my blog and reach a broader, more relevant audience in general. <br>
Looking forward to share my work with the community.
