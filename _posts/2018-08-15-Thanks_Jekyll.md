I would like to take the time and give credit where it's due - to the creators of jekyll-now, without which, setting up a blog <b>this</b> easily, would not have been possible.  
All I had to do was fork the repository and rename it and I was good to go! No hassles at all!  

I tweaked the themes and fonts to my liking and well...that's pretty much it. A nice responsive blog in just a few minutes!  
I highly recommend [jekyll-now](https://github.com/barryclark/jekyll-now) to anyone who's looking to set up their own blog on GitHub without worrying about the tedious coding.
