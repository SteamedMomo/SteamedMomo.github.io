This blog is finally ready! <br>
From now on, this is where I will be sharing all the projects/programs I make. I ran a blog on Blogspot <a href = "realmomosenpai.blogspot.com"> here </a>before deciding to switch to GitHub, to provide a more professional outlook to my blog and reach a broader, more relevant audience in general. <br>
Looking forward to share my work with the community.
